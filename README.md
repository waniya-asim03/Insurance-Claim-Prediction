## 📊 Task 04: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts

### 📌 Objective

Predict medical insurance charges based on personal attributes using a **Linear Regression** model.

### 📁 Dataset

* **Medical Cost Personal Dataset**
* Features include age, BMI, smoking status, region, and other personal details.
* Target variable: **charges**

### 🛠 Tools Used

* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

### 🔍 Work Done

* Loaded and inspected the dataset
* Encoded categorical variables
* Visualized the impact of:

  * BMI on insurance charges
  * Age on insurance charges
  * Smoking status on insurance charges
* Built a **Linear Regression** model
* Evaluated performance using:

  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

### ✅ Outcome

The model demonstrates how lifestyle and personal factors—especially smoking status and BMI—significantly influence medical insurance costs, showcasing effective regression modeling and error evaluation.
